# :hammer: StonkSmith

_Absolutely no day-trading._

Forge your financial data into a single source of truth. **StonkSmith**
scrapes, aggregates, and syncs your investment accounts into a unified
Google Sheets Dashboard.

---

## :rocket: Overview

StonkSmith is a Python-based tool designed to:

- :eye: Scrape data from multiple investment accounts
- :jigsaw: Aggregate holdings, balances, and performance
- :chart: Sync everything into a single Google Sheets dashboard
- :brain: Provide a centralized view of your net worth

No more bouncing between your squad of applications that are meant for
specific accounts because there isn't any current app that _just works_ for
all the accounts you own.

**ONE SHEET TO RULE THEM ALL!**

## :bricks: Project Structure

```text
StonkSmith/
|--- src/
|    |--- main.py            # CLI entry point
|    |--- etc/               # config, logging, connection, shells, paths
|    |--- brokers/           # one <name>.py + <name>/ package per broker
|    |--- modules/           # per-broker scrape/sync modules
|    |--- loaders/           # dynamic broker and module loading
|    |--- helpers/           # db, sheets, logging helpers
|--- tests/
|--- pyproject.toml
```

Each broker is a pair: `brokers/<name>.py` holds the login class, and
`brokers/<name>/` holds its `database.py`, `db_navigator.py`, and
`broker_args.py`. Both are loaded by file path, so the two may share a name.

---

## :wheel: Installation

Requires Python 3.14 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gerrrt/stonksmith.git
cd stonksmith
uv sync
```

Fidelity drives a real browser, so install the Playwright runtime once:

```bash
uv run playwright install firefox
```

---

## :pizza: Usage

```bash
uv run stonksmith --help
```

List the modules available for a broker:

```bash
uv run stonksmith schwab529plan -L
```

Run a module against an account:

```bash
uv run stonksmith schwab529plan -M schwab529plan -u <username> -p <password>
```

Or use a credential stored in the database instead of passing it on the
command line:

```bash
uv run stonksmith schwab529plan -M schwab529plan -id 1
```

Manage stored credentials and scraped balances:

```bash
uv run stonksmithdb
```

Inside that shell: `broker schwab529plan`, then `add creds <username>`,
`show creds`, `show accounts`, `export creds <file>`, `back`, `exit`.

---

## :key: Module Credential Access

During module execution (`on_login`), credentials are available from both
`context` and `connection`:

- Active authenticated credential:
  - `context.active_username`
  - `context.active_password`
- Raw CLI-provided credential lists:
  - `context.cli_usernames`
  - `context.cli_passwords`
- Backward-compatible connection fields:
  - `connection.username`
  - `connection.password`

Example:

```python
def on_login(self, context, connection):
    user = context.active_username or connection.username
    if not user:
        context.log.fail("No authenticated user found")
        return
    context.log.success(f"Running module for {user}")
```

## :lock: Security Note

This project handles sensitive financial data.

Current safeguards:

- **Secrets live in the OS keyring** (Keychain on macOS, Secret Service on
  Linux, Credential Locker on Windows). The SQLite database stores only a
  reference such as `schwab529plan:alice`, never the secret itself.
- `show creds` masks secrets. Set `audit_mode` and `reveal_chars_of_pwd` in
  `~/.stonksmith/stonksmith.conf` to reveal a short prefix when you need to
  tell two credentials apart.
- `export creds` writes the keyring reference, never the secret.
- Databases created before this change are migrated automatically on first
  open: each plaintext password moves into the keyring and the column is
  cleared in place.

Passing `-p` on the command line still exposes the secret to your shell
history and process list. Prefer `add creds` in `stonksmithdb` plus `-id`.

Never commit credentials to source control.

## :brain: Vision

Think of StonkSmith as your own personal financial command center.

The goal is to evolve this into a modular, extensible tool that:

- Scales with your life as you gain wealth
- Supports new platforms easily
- Gives you total visibility and control
